How do I approach designing software?
I design software with a measured approach. I prefer write down on paper my expected processes to reach the desired outcome for my code. If it doesn't work on paper, its probably not going to work on screen.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I have gained a few new design skills working on this project. The most important of which would be using loops when possible. Before this class, I would not have thought to use loops because I would be so fixated on learning the new content. I realize now that I should always be thinking about how to do this more efficiently rather than fixing efficiency at the end.
          
What design process did you follow for your project work?
My design process started out well, to incude adding my own function for making the camera follow the cursor. I lost a little of that when the new content I was unfamilliar with came by. By the end I was expirementing with ways I could section each shape into it's own function rather than keeping everything in the main loop.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I would like to separate my code into more functions as I am coding it in the future. While I had the notion to do so, it was after I made the rest of the project already so there was very little time.


How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developming programs with a meticulous approach, preferring to have each part be my best work before moving on. In addition, I tend to test early and test often so that I know each section of code I add is working as intended before moving on.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
My new development strategy for the 3D scene consisted of making the shape outside the scene and then moving it in place at the end. If I had to move the camera and deal with other objects being nearby or blocking my view it would reduce the quality of my work.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration made a huge improvement to my development, however there were some points where I put iteration in where it may have been less efficient. Loops to run 2 doesn't seem to always be the best idea, however it allowed me to make changes to add or remove shapes just by modifying the loop rather than adding a loop later.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I believe I learned more about how to work with a running copy. This time around I worked on other parts of the code when I ran into an error I could not solve and came back to that part later after I consulted my professor. This saved me quite a bit of development time since it reduced my downtime.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science is my dream job, so computer science is helping me reach my goals by being my goal. I want to be good at it and use these skills I am developing often.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This course expanded my skillset to include understanding the OpenGL libraries and how to use them. While I do not think my remaining courses for this degree use OpenGL, I may need to use libraries in a similar way for future terms. Knowing how to look into what a library has to offer as well as how to add and import them has been a valuable tool for the future.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
The content in this course has given me greater insight on what is going on behind the scenes of 3D modeling software. Particularly, the math involved as well as the algorithms that use this math which can result in the preferred shapes. In the future, I can apply this knowledge professionally as I generate algorithms for other programs, especially if they apply to shapes.
